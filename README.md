## About

> ### Application Overview

- Productivity Timer wants to help you to be productive and stay in focus.
- It may also helps your eyes to relax if it is experiencing dryness due to too much glare on your screen without a break.
- It was design to help others reducing procastination that leads them to be unproductive.

> ### What is Pomodoro Technique

- Pomodoro Technique is a **time management method** that will improve your focus and productivity. It encourages you to work within the time you have, rather than struggle against it.

- You will finish each day with a sense of accomplishment by doing nothing more than working in 25-minute blocks (called pomodoro sessions), followed by 5-minute breaks.

- Pomodoro Technique is popular with freelancers wanting to track time, students wishing to study more effectively and anyone looking to improve themselves at work or in their personal projects.

> ### How does it work

1. Choose task you'd like to get done.

2. Focus and minimize distractions.

3. Set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes, the standard pomodoro duration.

4. Work on the task until the Pomodoro timer rings.

5. Take a short break of 5 minutes, breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

6. Repeat the cycle and for every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 minutes or more.
